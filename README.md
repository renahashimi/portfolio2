#### Holidaze - Project Exam 2

Holidaze is a modern, user-friendly holiday venue booking platform I built as part of my final exam in Front-End Development at Noroff. The goal of the project was to demonstrate my ability to create dynamic, responsive web applications using React and Tailwind CSS. The platform allows users to browse various holiday destinations and make bookings directly through the site. I integrated API calls for fetching venue data, and focused on creating a clean, responsive user interface with smooth transitions.

**Technologies used:**

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

**Technologies used:**

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
